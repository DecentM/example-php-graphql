## Not maintained

This isn't a project of mine I'm going to be continually working on. Please
make sure you understand how it works before basing your work on this.  

## Why

I wanted to show an example of how GraphQL could be set up and why it's awesome.  

## How

0. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/DecentM/example-php-graphql.git`
0. Install dependencies: `cd example-php-graphql; composer install`
0. Run the server with PHP: `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`
0. Use your favourite GraphQL client [(playground, for example)](https://github.com/prismagraphql/graphql-playground/releases)
and connect to `http://localhost:8080`
